This project analyzes whether a New York City–based fashion retailer should focus on improving their **mobile app** or **website** experience. The company offers in-store styling sessions, after which customers order clothes digitally. Using data analysis and machine learning, this project provides insights to guide their strategic decision.

## 📊 Goal

Help the company decide whether to prioritize the **mobile app** or the **website** by analyzing customer behavior and building a predictive model.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* **Python** (Google Colab Notebook)
* **Libraries:**

  * Pandas
  * NumPy
  * Matplotlib
  * Seaborn
  * Scikit-learn

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model

* **Model Used:** Linear Regression
* Applied to identify relationships and predict which platform should be prioritized based on usage and customer trends.

## 🚀 Features

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
* Predictive modeling with Linear Regression
* Insights and recommendations for platform focus
