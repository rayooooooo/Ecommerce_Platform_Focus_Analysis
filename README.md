This project analyzes whether a New York City‚Äìbased fashion retailer should focus on improving their **mobile app** or **website** experience. The company offers in-store styling sessions, after which customers order clothes digitally. Using data analysis and machine learning, this project provides insights to guide their strategic decision.

## üìä Goal

Help the company decide whether to prioritize the **mobile app** or the **website** by analyzing customer behavior and building a predictive model.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

* **Python** (Google Colab Notebook)
* **Libraries:**

  * Pandas
  * NumPy
  * Matplotlib
  * Seaborn
  * Scikit-learn

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Model

* **Model Used:** Linear Regression
* Applied to identify relationships and predict which platform should be prioritized based on usage and customer trends.

## üöÄ Features

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
* Predictive modeling with Linear Regression
* Insights and recommendations for platform focus

## üîß How to Run

1. Open the Colab notebook: ([https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Bi3Fqkb371_6tWeirEyuCYIPFscKcpsP#scrollTo=v3fVUhcg5-VP](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Bi3Fqkb371_6tWeirEyuCYIPFscKcpsP#scrollTo=v3fVUhcg5-VP))
2. Install required libraries (if not pre-installed in Colab):

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Run all cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and model results.

## üìà Results

* Visual analysis comparing website vs. mobile app performance.
* Model predictions on which platform yields higher engagement.
* Strategic recommendation for the business.
